# Iris Flower Prediction 🌸
## Project Overview 🗺️
The Iris Flower Prediction project is a machine learning project that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features. The project uses the classic **Iris dataset**, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**.

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify iris flowers accurately based on these features.

## Dataset 🗃️
- **Features:**
  - Sepal Length (cm)
  - Sepal Width (cm)
  - Petal Length (cm)
  - Petal Width (cm)
- **Target:**
  - Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
- **Number of Records:** 150

## Technologies Used ⚛
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)


---

## Steps / Workflow 👷🏻‍♂️
1. Load and explore the dataset.  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.  
3. Preprocess the data (if necessary).  
4. Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM , or KNN).  
5. Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
6. Save the trained model for future predictions.

## How to Run 👨‍💻
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

## Results 🎯

* The model achieves an accuracy of 98%.

* Predictions can classify the three species of Iris flowers based on their features.
